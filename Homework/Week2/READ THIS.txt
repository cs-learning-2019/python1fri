The following are the instructions! Anytime you have homework you should read teh instructions!

At this point in time you should have Processing downloaded and installed Python Mode.
You have also started learning some basic things in Python which you have seen in class.
We have not gotten far enough for me to assign any homework so no homework for the week.

However, I do want you to practice submitting your homework so before the start of next class what
I need you to do is create a new Processing project and simply have a single line of code.
Just do print("Hello World"). Make sure to save this project. At the beginning of the next class
you will be asked to submit the .pyde file which contains the single line of code. To submit the file
all you need to do is put it in the chat in Microsoft Teams at the start of class. You can also email me
the file before or after class.

Good Luck.
