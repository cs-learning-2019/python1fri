Your HW is very simple.

If you were paying attention in class you should be able to answer these questions. You can find
all of the code you need from the code covered in class. You can also go to the worksheets
and find clear instructions on how to do a lot of the stuff. 

1) Find an image from Google Images that you like and download it. Be careful not to download viruses.

2) Write some code in Processing to display the image you picked. Basically what we did in class.

3) Find a sound effect from online and download it. I recommond using https://soundbible.com/.

4) Add some more code to play the sound effect exactly once.
